To use this plugin make sure you have installed the ark api https://gameservershub.com/forums/resources/ark-server-api.12/
Create a folder called GetRequestHookArk in Win64\ArkApi\Plugins\ and drag GetRequestHookArk.dll and config.json into it
Restart your server and upon full startup it should log Old Url and New Url to the server console!
